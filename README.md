ALEParser
=========

A simple python ALE (AvidLogExchange) parser. Updated to work in both python2 and python3.


About
-----
Originally written in early 2012 for a friend, I recently updated it to
be a class and to include line tracking with some better error handling.

TODO
----

- [x] turn it into a class.
- [x] allow it to accept strings, filenames and or file handles.
- [x] line tracking for better error messages.
- [ ] make it available on pypi, setup.py compatible.
- [ ] more documentation.
- [ ] better strict mode.
- [ ] better checking of valid arguments.
- [x] better testing framework.
